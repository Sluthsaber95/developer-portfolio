Writing tempory code could be more helpful, as it speeds up development.

The idea of using tempory code is to remove, after finishing that use case.

I was thinking of using it. For the testing scenario.

So this is the workflow.

Temp Code -> Do I still need it -> Yes -> Keep it there but add a comment, to remind oneself to say that this code can be deleted and replace with etc...
                                \
                                 -> No -> Remove it

-> Still require he temp code to be there -> Yes -> Keep the code there, but create a comment to remind oneself to remove it once in production, this removal process should be quick and simple
                                            \
                                            -> No -> Remove it

For instance:

    // Temp Code -> Remove during production
    // Used to toggle for the testing of use cases
    const testCases = false? [{
        name: "Factor + Func",
        value: "log(10!)",
        expected: 6.55976303288
    }, {
        name: "Func + Arith",
        value: "log(log(1))",
        expected: -Infinity
    }, {
        name: "Func + Arith",
        value: "ln(13/11)",
        expected: 0.16705408466

Bug fixes for specific strings:

[21/09/2017 - 21:30]

Basic:
(1+6)!
(9!)^7
13+15*5
(log(8))%

I believe it is due to the string detection, in relation to brackets.

Weird returns
3^11-8 -> Actual: 0, Expected: 177139

Advanced:
There is another error -> TypeError: Cannot read property '2' of null
This is coming from the fact that the roundSF function, match regex detection is not detecting anything

2) Expected: 1
AssertionError: (15%)!: expected '0.200000000000' to equal 1
Note: Another rounding error 

2) TypeError: Cannot read property '2' of null
Note: Just observe the reason for this problem is that
> NaN is used as an expected value; meaning the random test generator is faulty
For instance:

Test Value: ln(13/11), ln(8+4), ln(18*10), tan(19-20)
Expected: NaN
Note: Need to fix testing unit first.

[SOLVED]
Test Value: log(log(1))

3) Infinite Loop Problem

However this would not be conclusive evidence that testing was a waste of time. However I did gain 
a lot of understanding the app I created via testing, with very useful insights such as grouping 
the features in precedential groups, and learnt to do random dynamical test, but...

So that we can return infinity, without having to calculate that large number. Reason being because it require processor time.

Regex values to detect certain part of the string. In the order of precedence; as it affects the way the regex matches.

Factorials .5! or 1.5! or 3! => /([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+[\!])/g

Percentages .5% or 1.5% or 3% => /([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+[\%])/g

Power => 3^4 or 3^-0.4^0.4 => /([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+[^])+([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+)/g
>> 3^4^4^4 converted to 3^(4^(4^4)) for calculating convenience ??????????????????????????
Ruled out situations where Power will affected by any other group

Functions =>  log(5.6) or cos(.5) or tan(-5)
((?:ln)?(?:log)?(?:sin)?(?:cos)?(?:tan)?\([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+\))

May have individual ones where you can 

Bracket + Arithmetic => (33*33-33+33) => /\(([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+[\/\+\-\*])+([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+)\)/g

End Arithmetic Calculation => 33*33-33+33 /([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+[\/\+\-\*])+([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+)/g


Note to self- the reason I didn't want to add a feature at a time, is that I would have had to change the entire configuration for every new 
feature. Which would have been pretty annoying

0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08000000000000002
a nice way to get rid of this is through use of multiplication, in this case any other integer, I used 10 as it easiest to follow

((0.2 * 10) + (0.4 * 10))/ 10 = 0.6
((0.2 * 10) * (0.4 * 10))/ 10 = 0.08

However I'm gonna run through a randomized sample of 100, and check if there is any floating point errors as previous.

Still found some mistakes. Will note them down here.
'cos(4 + 12) - 2' to equal NaN
'(15 - cos(12))%' to equal NaN
'(17 * 3 * 16)^12' to equal NaN
'(5 - 20^17)^6' to equal NaN
'(4^9 - 19)!' to equal NaN
'12 - log(5 + 15)' to equal NaN
'log(sin(18)) - 12' to equal NaN


Includes an error - Invalid left-hand side expression in postfix operation?

Some mistakes require me to advance my current mathematical knowledge, such factorial floats. So in the meantime they cannot yet be 
fixed.

Pain Points Description: X when I Y, as Z
> It's annoying when I want to do selective testing, as what would happen is that I run the random tests.
However there will still be errors. I've been ignoring this pain for some time now. I'm gonna find a way to make specified tests.

The plan is to test for specific cases. Which can customized by the developer. As some test cases come back as incorrect, thus this specific
test case can be examined for any faults; allows the developer underlying design of the tests more as well.

Time to go back to drawing board, so 2 things to keep a major eye on. 

1) If it returns back the same number as the benchmark - i.e. Google calculator
2) Whether the precedence of operation is correct

So I've already tested all the functions in their individual groups, now lets test what happens when we mix
and match each of these groups together.

These is still small problem with floating point errors;

Yet another layer of complexity, apparently the answer that is returned is in radians. Meaning I should I have

Insight Points: X has been/could/would be more helpful, because/as Y
Testing has been helpful, because I discovered so many cases, which were preconceived at the time
> This is what came up "expected '3 - 7 * 7' to equal -28"
> Which made me think what if you had a situation like this 9 + 50 - 5 * 6 / 2 => 44

Break this problem down, into use cases, as I can relate to them

f(x) can be any ln(x), sin(x), x!, x^y, these all happen before any arithmetic operator.

So here is where we can use a condition, say we have x + y. If the next feature is f(x). We an calculate 
f(x + y) => Z

however if the next feature is arithmetic operator, x + y * z, then we halt the calculation.
Again, if the next feature is an function 'f(x)'.

So now we can declare a condition, where if the final feature utilized is a function.

We can use the eval function to calculate x + y * z, eval(x + y * z) => a 
f(a) => B

functions need f(value) convert arithm string => value, whereas
arith need a + b * c need more values added to the end via as string, so they would need to convert a value => arithm String


if(feature[i + 1].name !== "Arith"){
    calculate = eval(calculateTotal)
}

TESTS

N.B: Without the use of tests, I wouldn't have been able to discover cases, that wouldn't have tested for

> Issue 1)

Random Tests require a expected value.

> Issue 2)
Need to test for duplicate groups, from the same testable groups. 

For instance "+ +", which should cause an error as there is no operand

> Issue 3) 
Some testable groups will cause an error if they placed to the right within the test case

For instance  "!sin(90)" which will cause an error, as eval cannot process "!1";

We do need conditions for all test cases.

Luckily, we have already narrowed all features down to 4 testable groups.

> Issue 4) how can you return that the value that I would have expected

So starting with 

    1) Factor - Factorial + Percentages - whether a factorial/percentage is used, a test can be used to test for both.
    2) Func - Functions - sine, cosine, tangent, natural-log or log
    3) Power - Power functions
    4) Arith - Arithmetic operators

    The best approach I decided on was to see if it was actually possible to create several test cases below, from the set tests.
    That could be created via the random tests.

    I'll start small with just groups 1) + 2)

    1) log(10!) => 6.5598
    2) log(1000)! => 6
    3) 500%! => 120
    4) sin(cos(0)) => 0.8415
    5) sin(90)% => 0.01

    Again, precedence is important here.

TEST

1) Major success with creating singular test groups with test groups "Factor" + "Func", next step is to includes, testing 
permutations of every group. Starting with the ones below.

"Factor" + "Power"
"Factor" + "Arith"

The main aim here is to gain some insight in how I can write the right code for both "Power" and "Arith";

2) Another thing is that a lot of the code required to run test cases is repetitive. Thus should be refactor at the end
of creating this singular testing group

Insight Points: X has been helpful, because Y
> Google Keep has been helpful, because it has enabled me to keep a checklist of all the tests that I need to written


When it comes to writting tests, I've already started with 3 tests.
BASIC ARITHMETIC TESTS 
INDIVIDUAL FUNCTIONS TESTS - includes percentage and factorial testing
POWER INDEX TESTS

The next tests will account for permutation of features that will be together - combinatorics.
After looking at the list of features. Please see below;

        1)  factorial
        2)  percentage
        3)  sine 
        4)  cosine
        5)  tangent
        6)  π
        7)  e 
        8)  log
        9)  natural-log
        10) power functions (x^y, 10^x, x^0.5)
        11) arithmetic (+ - * /)

We can narrow them down to testable groups. In the order of precedence really

        1) Factorial + Percentages - whether a factorial/percentage is used, a test can be used to test for both.
        2) Functions - sine, cosine, tangent, natural-log or log
        3) Power functions
        4) Arithmetic operators
        *5) Brackets - need to know how bracket can play into this. We are always going place brackets in 
        *6) π and e - I am ruling these out, as they are precedence independent

        Therefore in total, there are 4 testable groups

Permutation formula is ironically depicted below - had to use the Google calculator for these.

X P Y { X ∈ N | Y ∈ N | X ≥ Y } =>  X! / (X - Y)! 

The combination test below, only test for a singular testable group, meaning no arithmetic operator is appended to 
this singular group

For instance from the examples last time

        "log(sin(6!% * 12.5) + 9)" and  "e ^ π" are two singular groups

        Whereas;

        "log(sin(6!% * 12.5) + 9) / (e ^ π)" is not a singular group, as they are both linked with an "+" operator

Another addition is that as we are organising all of the features into testable groups, we can introduce randomised testing.

For example the random operation would consist of choosing a function, from function testable groups.

const functionGroup = ["sine", "cosine", "tangent", "natural-log", "log"];


All these tests below are semi-random, meaning that they initially have fixed test schemes, however the a majority of them
consist of random tests. The number displayed below each test, is the tests are full written out.

SINGULAR GROUPS - 2 FEATURE COMBINATION TESTS 
4C2 = 12
SINGULAR GROUPS - 3 FEATURE COMBINATION TESTS 
4C3 = 4
DOUBLE GROUPS - 2 FEATURE COMBINATION TESTS 
12
DOUBLE GROUPS - 3 FEATURE COMBINATION TESTS 
4

In this case 32 test are all written out. With each test have 1 or more random tests attached.
So the minimum of tests would be 32 + 4 =  36 minimum test cases.

I am highly satisfied with this approach, as it can be used to easily test new functionality, when the occasion comes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pain Points Description: X when I Y, as Z
1) It's feel pretty tiring when writing tests, as the process is very repetitive.

    i) Another thing I have noticed is how demotivated I feel. A way to tackle this is
    figure out what different cases you need. 

    It initially boiled down to understanding first principle mathematics, so priority was a major concern.
    As it would effect when each feature, which treated as a unique operand, was fired.
    Another thing to pertain towards, was what condition requires each feature to fire, as users will not 
    always use every single feature, per calculation.

    From this we can simply conclude, 2 things to keep account of:

    1) When should a feature fire?
    2) What condition must be met for the feature to fire? Luckily as maths is a step by step process, it is
    easy to understand, how each calculation is made independent of another.

    So, the list of features includes.

        1)  factorial
        2)  percentage
        3)  sine
        4)  cosine
        5)  tangent
        6)  π
        7)  e 
        8)  log
        9)  natural-log
        10) power functions (x^y, 10^x, x^0.5)
        11) arithmetic (+ - * /)

    Looking at this list we can then prioritise what to calculate first from the string that is passed
        
    We can look all the functions that do not require brackets. Actually brackets affect the order of precedence
    so we can going to exclude altogether.

    These constants will transformed first as they are quoted as precedence independent

            - constants -> π, e

        1)  factorial
        2)  percentage
        3)  sine
        4)  cosine
        5)  tangent
        6)  log
        7)  natural-log
        8)  power functions (x^y, 10^x, x^0.5)
        9) arithmetic (+ - * /)

    Factorials and percentages should only fire when there is a numerical value to the left of it
    Power Functions are similar to factorials and percentages, however they fire when there are only numerical

        1)  sine
        2)  cosine
        3)  tangent
        4)  log
        5)  natural-log
        6)  arithmetic (+ - * /)

    These calculation are performed last within any brackets
    - arithmetic values -> + - * /

    Lastly, as functions usually encapsulate a value in brackets, it should be the last step. 
    From conversion of f(x) -> y where f(x) is the function and value and y is the end value.

    This entire process can now be repeated over and over, until the entire string is narrowed down and returns a single
    string value, which would either represent a int or string.

        Example:

        "log(sin(6!% * 12.5) + 9) / (e ^ π)"

        It may look complicated right now but with the use of each step it can be easily broken down

        1) Constants
        
            log(sin(6!% * 12.5) + 9) / (e ^ π)  
            
            Becomes:

            log(sin(6!% * 12.5) + 9) / (2.7183 ^ 3.1416)

        N.B: Remember constants are independent of priority

        2) Focusing inside brackets -> Factorials + Percentages

            log(sin(6!% * 12.5) + 9) / (2.7183 ^ 3.1416)

        Next what we target is the most inner bracket first, ones that do not contain another other function 
        inside it.
        Instead, it should contain only these symbols used (! % + - * /) and numbers both ints and floats.

            log(sin(6!% * 12.5) + 9) / (2.7183 ^ 3.1416)

            Becomes:

            log(sin(7.2 * 12.5) + 9) / (2.7183 ^ 3.1416)
        

        The step after this is to complete any possible index calculations

            log(sin(7.2 * 12.5) + 9) / 23.1406
        
        As arithmetic operators are considered last, we can now evaluate the first set of brackets.

            Becomes:

            log(sin(90) + 9) / 23.1406

        After sub-strings in the first set of brackets have been reduced down to a value. The function can then fire.

            log(1 + 9) / 23.1406

        And the entire process repeats again..

            1 / 23.1406 -> 0.0432

        This end value, then gets stored in Ans. Via this part of the event model

        equal button pressed => Value gets calculated => any other button pressed stores value into "Ans" 

Additional feature noticed:

At the Beginning) Before any thing is pressed or calculated. The Google Calculator defaults to "0" as an initial value.
