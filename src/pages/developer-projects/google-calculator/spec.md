Use Cases
As a user I can:

    - do basic arithmetic on the calculator, and it should be a numerical value
    - change radians to degree, vice versa, simply by clicking on the Rad/Deg toggle: 1 Radian -> 180/pi
    - change return the factorial of a number: 5! -> 120
    - use brackets to alter the precedence of the equation
    - convert percentage value to a numerical value: 150% -> 1.5
    - use the backspace key
        1) to delete the previous value, if I already entered that value; acts like CE on any other calculator: 123 -> 12, 4ln(5) -> 4ln(5
        2) to delete the entire value, after I have pressed the equals button; acts like the AC on any other calculator: 123 -> ""  , the "" depicts an empty string
    - use sine button to calculate the value of sin(x): Degrees is toggled on, sin(360) -> 0
    - use natural-log button to calculate the value of ln(x): ln(e) -> 1;
    - use pi button to get the constant of pi: 3.14159
    - use cosine button to calculate the value of cos(x): Degress is toggled on, cos(360) -> 1
    - use logarithm button to calculate the value of log(x): log(10) -> 1;
    - use e button to get the constant of e: 2.718281
    - use tangent button to calculate the value of tan(x): tan(45) -> 1;
    - use square root to calculate the value of x^1/2: 4^1/2 -> 2;
    - use answer button to get the previous answer stated from before
    - use exponential button to raise the exponent of base 10 10^y: 10^3 -> 1000;
    - use power button to raise the exponent of any base x^y: 2^10 -> 1024;
    - utilize the equals button, to return an answer
