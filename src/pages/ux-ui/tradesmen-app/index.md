## Product Aims

## Design Specs
### Type Ramp
![Type Ramp](./tradesmen-type-ramp.png)

__Fonts Used:__ Nunito Semi Bold, Nunito Bold

#### Why Nunito ?
Nunito is very friendly, readable and can pack text into tight spaces - useful for a lot of texts on apps.

Decided to go for a singular font, as no other aspect of the design required high contrasting of typefaces. With the added bonus of no *sacrifice* on text consistency.

### Color Palette
![Color Palette](./tradesmen-color-palette.png)

Went for the calming __Forest Green__ and __Royal Blue__ colours, the blue color to match the company logo.

__Orange__ and __Dark Turquoise__ were used a contrast, for actionable elements, such as the Turquoise confirm button when picking a date

### Iconography
![Iconography](./tradesmen-iconography.png)

The clean thin line designed icons gives the app, a more expensive feel, which ties in with the app development for iOS before Android. 

Smooth Border radii are much preferred to give each item a friendly feel
